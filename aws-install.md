# Quick Start Guide: Installing Conduit on Amazon Web Service (AWS)

This guide assumes experience configuring AWS EC2 instances. For support, contact our Conduit support via email at support@bpcs.com to schedule time for one of our architects to assist in the deployment.

**Prerequisites**
1. You have an EC2 instance available within AWS, along with EC2 Admin rights and root access. For instructions on creating an EC2 instance, check out [this article](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html). At a minimum, the EC2 instance needs to meet the following minimum requirements:
    - 4 cores
    - 16GB of RAM
    - Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS
2. Authorize inbound traffic for ports 80, 443 and 10002. For instructions on authorizing inbound traffic, check out [this article](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/authorizing-access-to-an-instance.html). You can limit access to the IP's that will access Conduit.
3. You should have received a .tar file from the Conduit team. If you have not received this file, please contact conduitsupport@bpcs.com for the file you will need.

## Installation
1. Upload the Conduit .tar.gz file and shell script to a folder on the EC2 instance.

2. Run the deployment script as root ./conduit-transformless-install.sh

3. When prompted, enter a name, email and password for the initial Conduit administrator account. If you have misplaced the credentials for your admin account, contact conduitsupport@bpcs.com for assistance.

4. When prompted, enter the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the EC2 instance. Example: ec2-74-728-49-824.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com.

5. Once the script completes, open a web browser and navigate to the FQDN entered in Step 4.

6. Login with the administrator credentials you entered in Step 3.
